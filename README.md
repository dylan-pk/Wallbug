# ðŸŒ± Wallbot System Development  

---

![Overview](https://img.shields.io/badge/Overview-%23184E77?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white)

The **Wallbot System Development** project represents the finalised redevelopment and delivery of the *Wallbot* platform by the **Wallbug Team** under the DMMS subject at the University of Technology Sydney.  
The system is designed to traverse vertical surfaces and function as a **plantâ€‘surveying robot**, equipped with sensors to monitor plant health and density.  

This project delivers an **investorâ€‘ready demonstration platform**, fulfilling requirements outlined in the *Project Scope and Specificationsâ€¯(Revâ€¯E)* and the *Project Handoverâ€¯Planâ€¯(Revâ€¯B)*.  
It demonstrates the integration of mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems, supported by a refined user interface and visual branding package.

![Objectives](https://img.shields.io/badge/Objectives-%233A5A40?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white)

- Develop a safe, reliable, and visually engaging **Wallbot demonstration platform**.  
- Enable **vertical traversal** and plant health data collection via onboard sensors.  
- Ensure **stable communication** between winches, motors, and control UI.  
- Integrate subsystems into a cohesive, modular architecture for ease of testing and reuse.  
- Deliver **complete handover documentation**, CAD, and functional demonstration video package.

![Scope](https://img.shields.io/badge/Scope-%23669EBC?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white)

**Inâ€‘Scope**  
- Wallbot vertical mobility and platform control  
- Motor coordination through CANBus and central controller  
- Sensor integration for plant health detection  
- Wireless control via UI panel  
- Redeveloped shell with improved cable and safety design  

**Outâ€‘ofâ€‘Scope**  
- Full autonomous navigation beyond predefined path  
- Extended weatherproofing or outdoor deployment  
- Longâ€‘term power autonomy or recharging integration  
- Multiâ€‘unit synchronisation beyond singleâ€‘system demo

![Requirements](https://img.shields.io/badge/Requirements-%23A3B18A?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=black)

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**  
- Safe cable management system and winch coordination  
- Preâ€‘programmed demonstration path for reliable motion  
- Wireless communication between UI and motor controllers  
- Visual indicator of plant health via colour segmentation (3â€¯stages)  
- Full documentation and build reproducibility  

**Stretch Goals**  
- Enhanced LED feedback and display integration  
- Automated start/stop demo sequence  
- Expanded telemetry data visualisation in UI
