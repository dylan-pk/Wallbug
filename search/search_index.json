Wallbug is designed to traverse vertical surfaces and demonstrate its role as a plant surveying robot, equipped with on-board sensors to monitor plant health and density. The end goal is to deliver an investor-ready demo unit that showcases technical capabilities, safety, and public appeal, while also serving as a stepping stone for smart city green wall technologies.</p>"},{"location":"#objectives","title":"\ud83c\udfaf Objectives","text":"<ul> <li>Refurbish and integrate Wallbot components into a reliable demonstration unit.</li> <li>Enable vertical traversal with wireless control and safe actuation.</li> <li>Collect and display plant health data through onboard camera systems.</li> <li>Improve aesthetics, safety, and UI for engaging demonstrations.</li> <li>Supply handover packages (CAD, code, documentation) for scalability.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#scope","title":"\ud83d\udce6 Scope","text":"<p>In-Scope - Robot movement and motor control - Wireless communication and control - Sensor integration and visual output - Mechanical shell redesign</p> <p>Out-of-Scope - Weather proofing for winch system - Z-axis climbing - Wind resistance at high altitude - Complex manipulation (e.g., pruning) - Renewable charging integration</p>"},{"location":"#requirements","title":"\u2705 Requirements","text":"<p>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Cable management system - Pre-planned movement demonstration - Modular, reusable subsystems - Camera data displayed on external monitor - Wireless communication - Plant health detection (3 colour stages)</p> <p>Stretch Goals - LED-based visual feedback - Autonomous docking/recharging - Autonomous movement - Single-press full demo sequence</p>"},{"location":"#deliverables","title":"\ud83d\udcc4 Deliverables","text":"<ul> <li>UI (D.1): Displays onboard sensors</li> <li>Functioning Demo (D.2): Pre-planned movement + wireless comms</li> <li>Mechanical Shell (D.3): Improved cable management + durability</li> <li>Documentation (D.4): Full technical + handover docs</li> <li>CAD (D.5) &amp; Code Files (D.6): Provided at handover</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#work-breakdown-structure","title":"\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Work Breakdown Structure","text":"<ul> <li>Mechanical: Shell redevelopment, winches, housing, safety systems</li> <li>Electrical: Motor communication (CANBus), wiring, load cells, control panel</li> <li>Mechatronics: Motor control (speed/motion), path planning, stability</li> <li>UI: Wireless control, real-time sensor display</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#visual-identity","title":"\ud83c\udfa8 Visual Identity","text":"<p>Wallbug colour palette | Colour Name  | Hex        | |--------------|------------| | Dark Green   | <code>#3A5A40</code>  | | Sage Green   | <code>#A3B18A</code>  | | Light Neutral| <code>#EAE8E2</code>  | | Blue         | <code>#669EBC</code>  | | Deep Blue    | <code>#184E77</code>  |</p>"},{"location":"#team-contributors","title":"\ud83d\udc65 Team &amp; Contributors","text":""},{"location":"#the-wallbug-team","title":"The Wallbug Team","text":"Name Role Responsibilities Anika Roth Electrical Lead Electrical design, embedded systems, wiring Anton Cecire Interface Lead UI design, interface integration Benjamin Cooper Movement Lead Wallbot movement, subsystem integration Connor Williams Industrial Comms Lead Motor communication (CANBus), firmware/software comms Dylan Purbrick Team Lead Organisation, documentation, client liaison Fadi Alameddine Mechanical Design Lead Mechanical design, CAD, prototyping"},{"location":"#extended-contributors","title":"Extended Contributors","text":"<ul> <li>Dana \u2013 Winches &amp; Mechanical Actuation  </li> <li>Adithya \u2013 External Student, Wallbot Project Management Support</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#client-coaching","title":"Client &amp; Coaching","text":"<ul> <li>Marc Carmichael \u2013 Client (UTS Robotics Institute, Head Tutor DMMS)</li> <li>Roy Wang \u2013 Project Coach</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#documentation","title":"\ud83d\udcda Documentation","text":"<p>All supporting materials, including CAD files, technical documentation, and meeting records, will be organised within the DMMS MS Teams dedicated Wallbot System Development Channel.
