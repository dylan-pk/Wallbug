The **Wallbot System Development** project aims to further develop and improve the current Wallbot into a fully functional **demonstration platform**.  
The **Wallbug Team** is responsible for the design and implementation of Wallbot.  

The system is designed to traverse vertical surfaces and demonstrate its role as a **plant surveying robot**, equipped with on-board sensors to monitor plant health and density.  

The end goal is to deliver an **investor-ready demo unit** that showcases technical capabilities, safety, and public appeal, while also serving as a stepping stone for **smart city green wall technologies**.

![Objectives](https://img.shields.io/badge/Objectives-%233A5A40?style=for-the-badge&logoColor=white)

- Refurbish and integrate Wallbot components into a reliable demonstration unit.  
- Enable **vertical traversal** with wireless control and safe actuation.  
- Collect and display **plant health data** through onboard camera systems.  
- Improve **aesthetics, safety, and UI** for engaging demonstrations.  
- Supply **handover packages** (CAD, code, documentation) for scalability.
