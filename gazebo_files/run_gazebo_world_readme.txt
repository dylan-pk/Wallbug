To install: Copy the models out to the respective folders. The SDF probably has absolute paths rn - to be fixed so that no copying is required.

To run: gazebo -u DMMS_WorldV1.sdf

This puts the sim into paused time mode - otherwise everything is affected by gravity lol. Designed to be a lookslike prototype that will be updated for simulating.
