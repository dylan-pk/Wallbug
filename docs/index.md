# üå± Wallbot System Development

## üìñ Overview
The **Wallbot System Development** aims to further develop and improve the current Wallbot system into a fully functional **demonstration platform**. Wallbug is designed to traverse vertical surfaces and demonstrate its role as a **plant surveying robot**, equipped with on-board sensors to monitor plant health and density.
The end goal is to deliver an **investor-ready demo unit** that showcases technical capabilities, safety, and public appeal, while also serving as a stepping stone for **smart city green wall technologies**.

## üéØ Objectives
- Refurbish and integrate Wallbot components into a reliable demonstration unit.
- Enable **vertical traversal** with wireless control and safe actuation.
- Collect and display **plant health data** through onboard camera systems.
- Improve **aesthetics, safety, and UI** for engaging demonstrations.
- Supply **handover packages** (CAD, code, documentation) for scalability.

## üì¶ Scope
**In-Scope**
- Robot movement and motor control
- Wireless communication and control
- Sensor integration and visual output
- Mechanical shell redesign

**Out-of-Scope**
- Weather proofing for winch system
- Z-axis climbing
- Wind resistance at high altitude
- Complex manipulation (e.g., pruning)
- Renewable charging integration

## ‚úÖ Requirements
**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
- Cable management system
- Pre-planned movement demonstration
- Modular, reusable subsystems
- Camera data displayed on external monitor
- Wireless communication
- Plant health detection (3 colour stages)

**Stretch Goals**
- LED-based visual feedback
- Autonomous docking/recharging
- Autonomous movement
- Single-press full demo sequence

## üìÑ Deliverables
- **UI (D.1)**: Displays onboard sensors
- **Functioning Demo (D.2)**: Pre-planned movement + wireless comms
- **Mechanical Shell (D.3)**: Improved cable management + durability
- **Documentation (D.4)**: Full technical + handover docs
- **CAD (D.5) & Code Files (D.6)**: Provided at handover

## üõ†Ô∏è Work Breakdown Structure
- **Mechanical**: Shell redevelopment, winches, housing, safety systems
- **Electrical**: Motor communication (CANBus), wiring, load cells, control panel
- **Mechatronics**: Motor control (speed/motion), path planning, stability
- **UI**: Wireless control, real-time sensor display
